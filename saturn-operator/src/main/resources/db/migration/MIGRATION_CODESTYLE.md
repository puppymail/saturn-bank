Please use specific syntax while writing migrations:
1. Don't start with empty line.
2. Put a newline between complex statements such as table definitions and so on.
3. End with empty line.
4. Migration file name should include action (`alter`, `create`, `delete`), what is edited(`table`, etc.), table name and brief description of changes(for example, when altering/deleting include rows affected and so on)
